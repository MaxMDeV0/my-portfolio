                        <p>I&#39;m a motivated and curious full stack web developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. I specialize in crafting user-friendly digital experiences and writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. With a background in PHP and JavaScript, and hands-on experience using technologies like React, Node.js, and WordPress, I enjoy bringing design and functionality together to create seamless web applications.</p>
                        <p>My journey into web development began with a strong interest in science and technology. I completed a full-stack developer training program at 3W Academy. Since then, I&#39;ve grown through professional experiences like my role at Alvaria where I designed mockups, integrated responsive HTML/CSS, customized WordPress themes and plugins, and contributed to robust, tested solutions.</p>
                        <p>Outside of my formal work,I&#39;built personal projects, including a CRM app using React Native and Firebase, and continuously push myself to learn new technologies. I thrive in both team-based and independent environments, and I bring a strong sense of service, organization, and adaptability to every project.</p>
                        <p>Feel free to check out my GitHub to see what I&#39;m building.</p>
